# This script sets up the dependencies and the database for the project
# I stole this (excellent) idea from thoughtbot, see their article about it here:
# https://robots.thoughtbot.com/bin-setup


# Set up Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Give the app a name and set it up on heroku
echo "What do you want to call this app?"
read app_name

# If the app isn't on heroku yet, run
if ! heroku create $app_name; then

# Set up database (migration and seeds)
