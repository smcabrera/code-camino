# Quickstart
A rails app template for quickly bootstrapping a new rails app. A repo that comes preloaded with my usual setup: a user scaffolding with devise for authentication, bootstrap for styling and some basic haml templates.
Partly took the idea from thoughtbot's suspenders gem (which has a *lot* more features!)
